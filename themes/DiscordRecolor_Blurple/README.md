# Discord Recolor: Blurple and CutTheCord Black

Two themes in one using [Discord Recolor](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/DiscordRecolor)¹ which was originally created by DevilBro. Switch between the dark and light themes in default Discord settings!

- Dark theme: **CutTheCord black theme**²
- Light theme: **Blurple theme**

## Notes

1. You can download the original Discord Recolor [here](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/DiscordRecolor).

2. Notice: **CutTheCord black theme** is by far NOT the same theme as [AMOLED Dark Theme Optimized](https://github.com/gx-hacker/discord-themes/tree/master/AMOLED-Dark-Theme-Optimized)!
